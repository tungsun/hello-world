# hello-world
I was a system administrator before moving into project management, and I bring in an engineering focus to my work. My specialty is to bring new technologies from concept to production to improve project delivery. Try new tools to improve the complex workflow. Simplify Financial Reporting with the BI visualization. Collaborate with product teams on modern software development methodology. I love to try new technologies and methods to solve problems.
